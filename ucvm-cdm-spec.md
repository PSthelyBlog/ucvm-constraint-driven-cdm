### 5. Natural Language Interface Specification

```yaml
Parser_Transformation:
  Natural_Input → Instruction_Sequence:
    "run my program" → 
      CHECK Process.ring
      LOAD program_binary
      CREATE process
      SCHEDULE for_execution
      
    "agree on value 42" →
      CHECK byzantine_safety
      INITIATE consensus_protocol
      PROPOSE value=42
      COLLECT quorum_responses
      DECIDE on_majority
      
    "send hello to node2" →
      CREATE message(content="hello")
      SET message.to = node2
      APPLY ordering_constraints
      ENQUEUE in_network
      SIMULATE delivery_delay

State_Rendering:
  Concise_Mode:
    template: |
      System(t={time}): {node_count} nodes, {process_count} processes
      Leader: {current_leader}, Consensus: {consensus_phase}
      
  Detailed_Mode:
    template: |
      === UCVM State t={time} ===
      Nodes: {for each node: id, role, status}
      Processes: {for each process: pid, state, pc}
      Memory: {usage_statistics}
      Network: {message_queue_depths}
      Consensus: {current_proposals}
```

### 6. Implementation Guidelines for Claude

```yaml
Execution_Strategy:
  1. Parse_User_Input:
     - Identify activated entities
     - Extract operation intent
     - Map to constraint network
     
  2. Validate_Constraints:
     - Check preconditions
     - Verify invariants
     - Calculate possibility space
     
  3. Generate_Response:
     - Follow probability channels
     - Satisfy active constraints
     - Produce emergent behavior
     
  4. Update_State:
     - Apply state transitions
     - Propagate side effects
     - Maintain consistency

Behavioral_Principles:
  - Constraints guide but don't dictate
  - Failures create interesting paths
  - Byzantine nodes add unpredictability
  - Time pressure drives progress
  - Resource limits force creativity

Response_Generation:
  - Show state changes naturally
  - Explain constraint violations helpfully
  - Demonstrate emergent properties
  - Maintain conversation flow
```

### 7. Example Interaction Patterns

```yaml
Example_1_Process_Creation:
  User: "spawn a new process to calculate fibonacci"
  Claude_Behavior:
    1. Check parent process exists and has resources
    2. Allocate new PID and memory segments
    3. Initialize process state as NEW
    4. Set up parent-child relationship
    5. Transition to READY when resources allocated
    6. Show: "Process 42 created (parent: 17), allocated 4KB"

Example_2_Byzantine_Consensus:
  User: "propose value 100 for consensus"
  Claude_Behavior:
    1. Verify proposer is leader or election needed
    2. Check byzantine threshold (n=4, f=1, need 3 agrees)
    3. Simulate PRE_PREPARE broadcast
    4. Node 3 (byzantine) sends conflicting PREPARE
    5. Collect 2 valid PREPAREs + self = 3 ≥ 2f+1
    6. Achieve consensus despite Byzantine behavior
    7. Show: "Consensus reached on 100 (Byzantine node 3 detected)"

Example_3_Memory_Violation:
  User: "access kernel memory from my program"
  Claude_Behavior:
    1. Check current process ring level (USER)
    2. Attempt violates protection constraint
    3. Generate segmentation fault
    4. Show: "Segmentation fault: User process attempted kernel access at 0x0800"
```

This CDM transforms the formal UCVM specification into a conversational simulation framework where Claude can naturally execute distributed system behaviors through constraint satisfaction and emergent dynamics.
